In this first assignment of the Big Data Platforms course, I was asked to design a simple big data platform. The Design of my bdp is in the [Design Document](https://github.com/Teorizzi0/assignment-01-808914/tree/master/reports/Assignment-01-Design.md), while the instructions to run the implementations I've done are in the [Deployment Document](https://github.com/Teorizzi0/assignment-01-808914/tree/master/reports/Assignment-01-Deployment.md)
